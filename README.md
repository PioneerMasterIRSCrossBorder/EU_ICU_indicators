## Design recommendations for sharing dynamic ICU data in EU cross border health information systems

Crises are often times of rethinking the current system and the breeding ground of innovation. Arguably one of the sectors most defined by and created for emergencies is the health sector. 
Health systems are created to accommodate for a certain expected amount of these emergencies, however, occasionally events happen straining the existing capacity. 
During the COVID-19 outbreak, health systems around the world found themselves struggling to handle the increased demand by COVID-19 patients while continuing to deliver essential health services (World Health Organization, 2020). 
As a result, health organizations urged governments to take several measures in order to tackle this crisis among which surveillance of indicators related to the disease (ECDC, 2020).
, mainly in the European context, countries were calling for cross-border cooperation between member states in order to alleviate the hardest hit health care systems and save lives (EC, 2020). 
These calls to action show that there is a value in cross-border health data gathering systems. 

The aims of this project is to prototype a semantic data model for designing a EU cross border interoperable HIS for sharing public health indicators about ICU bed.
More specifically, the model is a result of a regional and global case analisys that aims to analyze which and how the information related to ICU beds and availability data are provided in the context of the pandemic, identifying the data formats, implementation technology and common concepts.
